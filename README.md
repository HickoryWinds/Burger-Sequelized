## Burger-Sequelized

#### Burger-Sequelized is an app that lets the user 'devour' one of the burgers in the 'To Be Eaten' by clicking on a 'Devour' button. The app has prepopulated burgers in the 'To Be Eaten' list. The user may also add a new burger of their own choice to be listed with the option to 'devour' this burger.
